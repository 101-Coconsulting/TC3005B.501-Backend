## Create HTTPS certificates

To succesfully create the certificates to use the server with HTTPS you will need to follow the next steps:

> [!Important]
> You have to download the .cnf file provided in OneDrive and place it in the `TC3005B.501-Backend/certs` directory.

- Access the directory `TC3005B.501-Backend/certs`
- Run the next line of code in the terminal to make the file and executable:

  ```gitbash
  chmod +x create_certs.sh
  ```
  
- Run this line of code to create the certificates:

    ```gitbash
  ./create_certs.sh
  ```

Now you should have 6 new files in the `TC3005B.501-Backend/certs` directory and should be able to run the server using HTTPS.

> [!Caution]
> After creating the certificates, when making a commit be sure not to be uploading the certificates to the repository.
